      <p>
        <span class="emphasis">Thank you for considering me as a tutor!</span> I
        am truly grateful for being given the opportunity to be a tutor, and as
        such, I aim to provide the best experience possible.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If this is your first time receiving tutoring from me, I normally have a
        short introduction meeting with parents in order to ensure that I am
        able to deliver <span class="emphasis">the best support possible</span>.
        Please send me <a href="mailto:tutoring@saharsh.tech">an email</a> or
        use the form below to schedule a quick meeting with me.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you have already received tutoring from me before and would just like
        to schedule another tutoring session, feel free to
        <span class="emphasis">request for as much time as you would like</span>
        and you can pay me based on the rate that we have previously agreed on.
        To schedule a meeting, you can
        <a href="mailto:tutoring@saharsh.tech">email me</a> or use the form
        below. If you would like to request a session longer than one hour,
        please schedule two, back-to-back, sessions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="emphasis">My hourly prices are negotiable</span>, so feel
        free to bring up a price that you are comfortable with during our
        preliminary meeting. You can choose to pay in cash when we meet in
        person, or through
        <a href="https://paypal.me/saharshy">PayPal</a> (please use personal
        payments).
